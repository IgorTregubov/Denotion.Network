I deceived you. Programming is easy. Yes, software developers have written huge mountains of documents on clean code, software development paradigms, argue about the validity of the 'if' operator, and make jokes about 'for' loops. Entire forests of books call on you to write code better, cleaner, more efficiently, and more safely. All of this is no longer necessary. Automation systems for writing code are taking the stage.
Finally, artificial intelligence provides real assistance. It is not alive, it does not tire, it does not make errors due to human factors and other shortcomings inherent in humans from the moment of their birth. Simply put, a huge part of the time spent writing a program goes to routine tasks that require not so much thinking and brainstorming as time and resources from our bodies. Fortunately, artificial intelligence can perform routine actions in a matter of seconds, without making any mistakes.
Yes.
The news is here, everywhere. ChatGPT created a website, an Android application, a game, and a business.
Perhaps.
The help of ChatGPT can be significant if you know how to ask the right questions (it's a true saying that half the answer is in a well-asked question). In its current form, ChatGPT is not capable of effectively solving even moderately complex tasks on its own. It requires an expert who can evaluate and correct its results at every step. If you couldn't write an Android application yourself, ChatGPT won't do it for you. If you can't write a website in Vue.js, ChatGPT won't do it for you. ChatGPT operates in many specialized areas. For specific questions about, say, the nuances of operating certain car brands or firearms, you will receive very general answers, often filled with water. This allows you to fill in obvious knowledge gaps but not to deepen your understanding of the subject.
But at the same time, we are losing quite a bit of control. Programming is a way of expressing potential solutions in a language that a computer can understand. The hardest part of programming is understanding the problem, finding a solution, testing it, and evaluating its correctness. Most engineer-programmers are quite good at understanding code. Of course, they google a lot of stuff every day, but in general, they are confident in the syntax, tools, and programming methods at their disposal.
And more often than not, the real problems that an engineer has to solve are much more difficult than writing simple code snippets. These problems take up the lion's share of their time, not just any elementary routine.
Also, it's impossible to become a certified engineer-programmer without learning how to code and program, and AI products make young specialists less qualified.
But yes, programming is so easy.
