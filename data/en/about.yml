    title : App without OOP design
    description : |
        Experimental app. Keep SOLID princepes but not using OOP design. 
        - The app goal is to overceme OOP issues:
        - Inheritance structures imposes restrictions on entity relations and  often  contradicts with buisness logic.
        - Tight coupling between classes and fragile base class problem.
        - Code duplication and increased complexity.
